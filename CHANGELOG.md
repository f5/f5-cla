# Unreleased

## Changed

- Enhanced CLA workflow to handle trailing punctuation in user comments. The workflow now automatically normalizes comments by trimming whitespace and removing trailing punctuation marks (`.`, `!`, `?`, `;`, `,`), allowing users to naturally add punctuation to their CLA agreement statement without causing approval failures.
